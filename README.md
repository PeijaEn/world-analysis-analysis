### Overview
My job ws to take a customers desired temperature range and find hotels that fit that range. I then suggested 4 of the cities and mapped out a route for the customers needs.

### Results
All of my screenshots and outputs are within my weather_data folder, deliverable 3 wouldn't save as SS so outputs are in the code 

### Summary
Based on using the google API, I can see how this can be very powerful and informative
